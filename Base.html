<p style="font-family:courier;">Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published

developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.
 The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 
(cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Iron Man's Marvel Comics premiere in Tales of Suspense #39 
(cover dated March 1963)
 was a collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, 
story-artist Don Heck, and cover-artist and character-designer Jack Kirby.[4] In 1963,
 Lee had been toying with the idea of a businessman superhero.[5] He wanted to 
create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of 
the times and Marvel's readership.[6] Lee said.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="4495119-iron-man-wallpapers-hd.jpg" alt="IRON MAN" style="width:400px;height:200px;"></p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The original Iron Man title explored Cold War themes, 
as did other Stan Lee projects
 in the early years of Marvel Comics. Where The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk 
respectively focused on American domestic and government responses to the Communist
 threat, Iron Man explored industry's role in the struggle. Tony Stark's real-life model, 
Howard Hughes, was a significant defense contractor who developed new weapons
 technologies. Hughes was an icon both of American individualism and of the 
burdens of fame.[20]</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;"><u>SOLO SERIES<u></h4>
<p style="font-family:courier;">After issue #99 (March 1968), the Tales of Suspense series was renamed Captain America. 
An Iron Man story appeared in the one-shot comic Iron Man and Sub-Mariner (April 1968),
 before the "Golden Avenger"[21] made his solo debut with Iron Man #1 (May 1968).[22] 
The series' indicia gives its copyright title Iron Man, while the trademarked cover logo of
 most issues is The Invincible Iron Man.</p>
